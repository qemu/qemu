For information on the specifics of these extensions, please refer
to the `Armv8-A Arm Architecture Reference Manual
<https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest>`_.

When a specific named CPU is being emulated, only those features which
are present in hardware for that CPU are emulated. (If a feature is
not in the list above then it is not supported, even if the real
hardware should have it.) The ``max`` CPU enables all features.

R-profile CPU architecture support
==================================

QEMU's TCG emulation support for R-profile CPUs is currently limited.
We emulate only the Cortex-R5 and Cortex-R5F CPUs.

M-profile CPU architecture support
==================================

QEMU's TCG emulation includes support for Armv6-M, Armv7-M, Armv8-M, and
Armv8.1-M versions of the M-profile architucture.  It also has support
for the following architecture extensions:

- FP (Floating-point Extension)
- FPCXT (FPCXT access instructions)
- HP (Half-precision floating-point instructions)
- LOB (Low Overhead loops and Branch future)
- M (Main Extension)
- MPU (Memory Protection Unit Extension)
- PXN (Privileged Execute Never)
- RAS (Reliability, Serviceability and Availability): "minimum RAS Extension" only
- S (Security Extension)
- ST (System Timer Extension)

For information on the specifics of these extensions, please refer
to the `Armv8-M Arm Architecture Reference Manual
<https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0553/latest>`_.

When a specific named CPU is being emulated, only those features which
are present in hardware for that CPU are emulated. (If a feature is
not in the list above then it is not supported, even if the real
hardware should have it.) There is no equivalent of the ``max`` CPU for
M-profile.
