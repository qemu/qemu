.. _MIPS-System-emulator:

MIPS System emulator
--------------------

Four executables cover simulation of 32 and 64-bit MIPS systems in both
endian options, ``qemu-system-mips``, ``qemu-system-mipsel``
``qemu-system-mips64`` and ``qemu-system-mips64el``. Five different
machine types are emulated:

-  A generic ISA PC-like machine \"mips\"

-  The MIPS Malta prototype board \"malta\"

-  An ACER Pica \"pica61\". This machine needs the 64-bit emulator.

-  MIPS emulator pseudo board \"mipssim\"

-  A MIPS Magnum R4000 machine \"magnum\". This machine needs the
   64-bit emulator.

The generic emulation is supported by Debian 'Etch' and is able to
install Debian into a virtual disk image. The following devices are
emulated:

-  A range of MIPS CPUs, default is the 24Kf

-  PC style serial port

-  PC style IDE disk

-  NE2000 network card

The Malta emulation supports the following devices:

-  Core board with MIPS 24Kf CPU and Galileo system controller

-  PIIX4 PCI/USB/SMbus controller

-  The Multi-I/O chip's serial device

-  PCI network cards (PCnet32 and others)

-  Malta FPGA serial device

-  Cirrus (default) or any other PCI VGA graphics card

The Boston board emulation supports the following devices:

-  Xilinx FPGA, which includes a PCIe root port and an UART

-  Intel EG20T PCH connects the I/O peripherals, but only the SATA bus
   is emulated

The ACER Pica emulation supports:

-  MIPS R4000 CPU

-  PC-style IRQ and DMA controllers

-  PC Keyboard

-  IDE controller

The MIPS Magnum R4000 emulation supports:

-  MIPS R4000 CPU

-  PC-style IRQ controller

-  PC Keyboard

-  SCSI controller

-  G364 framebuffer

The Fuloong 2E emulation supports:

-  Loongson 2E CPU

-  Bonito64 system controller as North Bridge

-  VT82C686 chipset as South Bridge

-  RTL8139D as a network card chipset

The mipssim pseudo board emulation provides an environment similar to
what the proprietary MIPS emulator uses for running Linux. It supports:

-  A range of MIPS CPUs, default is the 24Kf

-  PC style serial port

-  MIPSnet network emulation

nanoMIPS System emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Executable ``qemu-system-mipsel`` also covers simulation of 32-bit
nanoMIPS system in little endian mode:

-  nanoMIPS I7200 CPU

Example of ``qemu-system-mipsel`` usage for nanoMIPS is shown below:

Start system emulation of Malta board with nanoMIPS I7200 CPU::

   qemu-system-mipsel -cpu I7200 -kernel <kernel_image_file> \
       -M malta -serial stdio -m <memory_size> -hda <disk_image_file> \
       -append "mem=256m@0x0 rw console=ttyS0 vga=cirrus vesa=0x111 root=/dev/sda"
