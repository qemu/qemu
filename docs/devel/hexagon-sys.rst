Hexagon System Architecture
===========================

The hexagon architecture has some unique elements which are described here.

Interrupts
----------
When interrupts arrive at a Hexagon DSP core, they are priority-steered to
be handled by an eligible hardware thread with the lowest priority.

Memory
------
Each hardware thread has an ``SSR.ASID`` field that contains its Address
Space Identifier.  This value is catenated with a 32-bit virtual address -
the MMU can then resolve this extended virtual address to a physical address.

TLBs
----
The format of a TLB entry is shown below.

.. note::
    The Small Core DSPs have a different TLB format which is not yet
    supported.

* ASID: the address-space identifier
* A1, A0: the behavior of these cache line attributes are not modeled by QEMU.
* xP: the extra-physical bit is the most significant physical address bit.
* S: the S bit and the LSBs of the physical page indicate the page size
* val: this is the 'valid' bit, when set it indicates that page matching
  should consider this entry.

* glb: if the global bit is set, the ASID is not considered when matching
  TLBs.
* Cacheab: the cacheability attributes of TLBs are not modeled, these bits
  are ignored.
* RWX: read-, write-, execute-, enable bits.  Indicates if user programs
  are permitted to read/write/execute the given page.
* U: indicates if user programs can access this page.

Scheduler
---------
The Hexagon system architecture has a feature to assist the guest OS
task scheduler.  The guest OS can enable this feature by setting
``SCHEDCFG.EN``.  The ``BESTWAIT`` register is programmed by the guest OS
to indicate the priority of the highest priority task waiting to run on a
hardware thread.  The reschedule interrupt is triggered when any hardware
thread's priority in ``STID.PRIO`` is worse than the ``BESTWAIT``.  When
it is triggered, the ``BESTWAIT.PRIO`` value is reset to 0x1ff.

HVX Coprocessor
---------------
The Supervisor Status Register field ``SSR.XA`` binds a DSP hardware thread
to one of the eight possible HVX contexts.  The guest OS is responsible for
managing this resource.
