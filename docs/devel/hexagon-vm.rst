Hexagon Virtual Machine
=======================

The hexagon virtual machine is a hypervisor that can partition a single
Hexagon DSP among multiple guest operating systems, and abstracts the
specific details of a DSP architectural revision for the sake of consistency
among generations.

Events
------

The guest operating system should register the Guest Event Vector Base
via the ``vmsetvec`` virtual instruction at system startup.  The vector table
and handlers are determined by the guest OS.

Guests return from event handlers with ``vmrte``.  This instruction will restore
the mode (user versus guest), interrupt enable state, PC, SP.

     - increasing interrupt numbers have descending priority

Startup
-------
In order to transition to user-mode, the guest OS must set the ``UM`` bit in
the guest status register and specify the address to start executing in
user mode in the guest event link register.
