# This file lists the ***oldest possible dependencies*** needed to run
# "make check" successfully under ***Python 3.7***. It is used primarily
# by GitLab CI to ensure that our stated minimum versions in setup.cfg
# are truthful and regularly validated.
#
# This file should not contain any dependencies that are not expressed
# by the [devel] section of setup.cfg, except for transitive
# dependencies which must be enumerated here explicitly to eliminate
# dependency resolution ambiguity.
#
# When adding new dependencies, pin the very oldest non-yanked version
# on PyPI that allows the test suite to pass.
