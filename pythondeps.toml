# This file describes Python package requirements to be
# installed in the pyvenv Python virtual environment.
#
# Packages are placed in groups, which are installed using
# the ensuregroup subcommand of python/scripts/mkvenv.py.
# Each group forms a TOML section and each entry in the
# section is a TOML key-value list describing a package.
# All fields are optional; valid fields are:
#
# - accepted: accepted versions when using a system package
# - installed: fixed version to install in the virtual environment
#              if a system package is not found; if not specified,
#              defaults to the same as "accepted" or, if also missing,
#              to the newest version available on PyPI.
# - canary: if specified, use this program name to present more
#           precise error diagnostics to the user.  For example,
#           'sphinx-build' can be used as a bellwether for the
#           presence of 'sphinx' in the system.

# The install key should match the version in python/wheels/
