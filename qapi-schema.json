# = Introduction
#
# This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.
#
# Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user Monitor, this
# means that any other document which also describe commands (the manpage,
# QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be consulted.
#
# QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands. Regular commands
# usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while query commands just
# return information. The sections below are divided accordingly.
#
# It's important to observe that all communication examples are formatted in
# a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to understand. However, in real
# protocol usage, they're emitted as a single line.
#
# Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:
#
# Example:
#
# | -> data issued by the Client
# | <- Server data response
#
# Please, refer to the QMP specification (docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt) for
# detailed information on the Server command and response formats.
#
# = Stability Considerations
#
# The current QMP command set (described in this file) may be useful for a
# number of use cases, however it's limited and several commands have bad
# defined semantics, specially with regard to command completion.
#
# These problems are going to be solved incrementally in the next QEMU releases
# and we're going to establish a deprecation policy for badly defined commands.
#
# If you're planning to adopt QMP, please observe the following:
#
#     1. The deprecation policy will take effect and be documented soon, please
#        check the documentation of each used command as soon as a new release of
#        QEMU is available
#
#     2. DO NOT rely on anything which is not explicit documented
#
#     3. Errors, in special, are not documented. Applications should NOT check
#        for specific errors classes or data (it's strongly recommended to only
#        check for the "error" key)

# @qmp_capabilities:
#
# Enable QMP capabilities.
#
# Arguments: None.
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "qmp_capabilities" }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
# Notes: This command is valid exactly when first connecting: it must be
# issued before any other command will be accepted, and will fail once the
# monitor is accepting other commands. (see qemu docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt)
#
# Since: 0.13
#
##

##
# @StrOrNull:
#
# This is a string value or the explicit lack of a string (null

#
# @delay: continue to deliver ticks at the normal rate.  Guest time will be
#         delayed due to the late tick
#
# @merge: merge the missed tick(s) into one tick and inject.  Guest time
#         may be delayed, depending on how the OS reacts to the merging
#         of ticks
#
# @slew: deliver ticks at a higher rate to catch up with the missed tick. The
#        guest time should not be delayed once catchup is complete.

# @MigrationCapability:
#
# Migration capabilities enumeration
#
# @xbzrle: Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length Encoding).
#          This feature allows us to minimize migration traffic for certain work
#          loads, by sending compressed difference of the pages
#
# @rdma-pin-all: Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
#          mlock()'d on demand or all at once. Refer to docs/rdma.txt for usage.
#          Disabled by default. (since 2.0)
#
# @zero-blocks: During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently. This
#          essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire. Enabling requires
#          source and target VM to support this feature. To enable it is sufficient
#          to enable the capability on the source VM. The feature is disabled by
#          default. (since 1.6)
#
# @compress: Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
#          This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by sending
#          compressed pages. Please note that if compress and xbzrle are both
#          on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk stage, after that,
#          it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes effect, this can help to
#          minimize migration traffic. The feature is disabled by default.
#          (since 2.4 )
#
# @events: generate events for each migration state change
#          (since 2.4 )
#
# @auto-converge: If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest
#          to speed up convergence of RAM migration. (since 1.6)
#
# @postcopy-ram: Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
#          been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed. NOTE: If
#          the migration fails during postcopy the VM will fail.  (since 2.6)
#
# @x-colo: If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM on the
#        primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on secondary
#        side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck Stepping (COLO) for
#        Non-stop Service. (since 2.8)
#
# @release-ram: if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the source
#        during postcopy-ram migration. (since 2.9)
#
# @block: If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
#          devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
#          mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
#          offers more flexibility.
#          (Since 2.10)
#
# @return-path: If enabled, migration will use the return path even
#               for precopy. (since 2.10)
#
# Since: 1.2

# @MigrationParameter:
#
# Migration parameters enumeration
#
# @compress-level: Set the compression level to be used in live migration,
#          the compression level is an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means
#          no compression, 1 means the best compression speed, and 9 means best
#          compression ratio which will consume more CPU.
#
# @compress-threads: Set compression thread count to be used in live migration,
#          the compression thread count is an integer between 1 and 255.
#
# @decompress-threads: Set decompression thread count to be used in live
#          migration, the decompression thread count is an integer between 1
#          and 255. Usually, decompression is at least 4 times as fast as
#          compression, so set the decompress-threads to the number about 1/4
#          of compress-threads is adequate.
#
# @cpu-throttle-initial: Initial percentage of time guest cpus are throttled
#                        when migration auto-converge is activated. The
#                        default value is 20. (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-increment: throttle percentage increase each time
#                          auto-converge detects that migration is not making
#                          progress. The default value is 10. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-creds: ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials for
#             establishing a TLS connection over the migration data channel.
#             On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials must
#             be for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
#             credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint. Setting this
#             will enable TLS for all migrations. The default is unset,
#             resulting in unsecured migration at the QEMU level. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-hostname: hostname of the target host for the migration. This is
#                required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
#                migration URI does not already include a hostname. For
#                example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the
#                hostname must be provided so that the server's x509
#                certificate identity can be validated. (Since 2.7)
#
# @max-bandwidth: to set maximum speed for migration. maximum speed in
#                 bytes per second. (Since 2.8)
#
# @downtime-limit: set maximum tolerated downtime for migration. maximum
#                  downtime in milliseconds (Since 2.8)
#
# @x-checkpoint-delay: The delay time (in ms) between two COLO checkpoints in
#          periodic mode. (Since 2.8)
#
# @block-incremental: Affects how much storage is migrated when the
# 	block migration capability is enabled.  When false, the entire
# 	storage backing chain is migrated into a flattened image at
# 	the destination; when true, only the active qcow2 layer is
# 	migrated and the destination must already have access to the
# 	same backing chain as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)

##
# @transaction:
#
# Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically. If any
# operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be abandoned and the
# appropriate error returned.
#
# For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the file to use for
# the new snapshot, and the format.  The default format, if not specified, is
# qcow2.
#
# Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
# contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to reuse
# an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should ensure that
# the new image file has the same contents as the current one; QEMU cannot
# perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is achieved by using the
# current image file as the backing file for the new image.
#
# On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.
#
# For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the snapshot's
# name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already exists, the request will
# be rejected.  Only some image formats support it, for example, qcow2, rbd,
# and sheepdog.
#
# On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal snapshot in the
# transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during deletion, the user needs to fix
# it later with qemu-img or other command.
#
# @actions: List of @TransactionAction;

#              for additional detail.
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#
#          Errors depend on the operations of the transaction
#
# Note: The transaction aborts on the first failure.  Therefore, there will be
# information on only one failed operation returned in an error condition, and
# subsequent actions will not have been attempted.

#
# @path: The path within the object model.  There are two forms of supported
#        paths--absolute and partial paths.
#
#        Absolute paths are derived from the root object and can follow child<>
#        or link<> properties.  Since they can follow link<> properties, they
#        can be arbitrarily long.  Absolute paths look like absolute filenames
#        and are prefixed  with a leading slash.
#
#        Partial paths look like relative filenames.  They do not begin
#        with a prefix.  The matching rules for partial paths are subtle but
#        designed to make specifying objects easy.  At each level of the
#        composition tree, the partial path is matched as an absolute path.
#        The first match is not returned.  At least two matches are searched
#        for.  A successful result is only returned if only one match is
#        found.  If more than one match is found, a flag is return to
#        indicate that the match was ambiguous.
#
# @property: The property name to read
#
# Returns: The property value.  The type depends on the property
#          type. child<> and link<> properties are returned as #str
#          pathnames.  All integer property types (u8, u16, etc) are

#        guest.  Hot removal is an operation that requires guest cooperation.
#        This command merely requests that the guest begin the hot removal
#        process.  Completion of the device removal process is signaled with a
#        DEVICE_DELETED event. Guest reset will automatically complete removal
#        for all devices.

##
# @dump-guest-memory:
#
# Dump guest's memory to vmcore. It is a synchronous operation that can take
# very long depending on the amount of guest memory.
#
# @paging: if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping. This allows
#          using gdb to process the core file.
#
#          IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several gigabytes
#                     of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
#                     malicious guest pretending to be large.
#
#          Also, paging=true has the following limitations:
#
#             1. The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have corrupted
#                memory, which cannot be trusted
#             2. The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled. For
#                example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep state
#                goes in real-mode
#             3. Currently only supported on i386 and x86_64.
#
# @protocol: the filename or file descriptor of the vmcore. The supported
#            protocols are:
#
#            1. file: the protocol starts with "file:", and the following
#               string is the file's path.
#            2. fd: the protocol starts with "fd:", and the following string
#               is the fd's name.
#
# @detach: if true, QMP will return immediately rather than
#          waiting for the dump to finish. The user can track progress
#          using "query-dump". (since 2.6).
#
# @begin: if specified, the starting physical address.
#
# @length: if specified, the memory size, in bytes. If you don't
#          want to dump all guest's memory, please specify the start @begin
#          and @length
#
# @format: if specified, the format of guest memory dump. But non-elf
#          format is conflict with paging and filter, ie. @paging, @begin and
#          @length is not allowed to be specified with non-elf @format at the
#          same time (since 2.0)
#
# Note: All boolean arguments default to false
#
# Returns: nothing on success
