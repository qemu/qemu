//! Helper macros to declare migration state for device models.
//!
//! This module includes four families of macros:
//!
//! * [`vmstate_unused!`](crate::vmstate_unused) and
//!   [`vmstate_of!`](crate::vmstate_of), which are used to express the
//!   migration format for a struct.  This is based on the [`VMState`] trait,
//!   which is defined by all migrateable types.
//!
//! * [`impl_vmstate_forward`](crate::impl_vmstate_forward) and
//!   [`impl_vmstate_bitsized`](crate::impl_vmstate_bitsized), which help with
//!   the definition of the [`VMState`] trait (respectively for transparent
//!   structs and for `bilge`-defined types)
//!
//! * helper macros to declare a device model state struct, in particular
//!   [`vmstate_subsections`](crate::vmstate_subsections) and
//!   [`vmstate_fields`](crate::vmstate_fields).
//!
//! * direct equivalents to the C macros declared in
//!   `include/migration/vmstate.h`. These are not type-safe and only provide
//!   functionality that is missing from `vmstate_of!`.
