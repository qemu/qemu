//! BQL-protected mutable containers.
//!
//! Rust memory safety is based on this rule: Given an object `T`, it is only
//! possible to have one of the following:
//!
//! - Having several immutable references (`&T`) to the object (also known as
//!   **aliasing**).
//! - Having one mutable reference (`&mut T`) to the object (also known as
//!   **mutability**).
//!
//! This is enforced by the Rust compiler. However, there are situations where
//! this rule is not flexible enough. Sometimes it is required to have multiple
//! references to an object and yet mutate it. In particular, QEMU objects
//! usually have their pointer shared with the "outside world very early in
//! their lifetime", for example when they create their
//! [`MemoryRegion`s](crate::bindings::MemoryRegion).  Therefore, individual
//! parts of a  device must be made mutable in a controlled manner through the
//! use of cell types.
//!
//! [`BqlCell<T>`] and [`BqlRefCell<T>`] allow doing this via the Big QEMU Lock.
//! While they are essentially the same single-threaded primitives that are
//! available in `std::cell`, the BQL allows them to be used from a
//! multi-threaded context and to share references across threads, while
//! maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.  For this reason, unlike
//! their `std::cell` counterparts, `BqlCell` and `BqlRefCell` implement the
//! `Sync` trait.
//!
//! BQL checks are performed in debug builds but can be optimized away in
//! release builds, providing runtime safety during development with no overhead
//! in production.
//!
//! The two provide different ways of handling interior mutability.
//! `BqlRefCell` is best suited for data that is primarily accessed by the
//! device's own methods, where multiple reads and writes can be grouped within
//! a single borrow and a mutable reference can be passed around.  Instead,
//! [`BqlCell`] is a better choice when sharing small pieces of data with
//! external code (especially C code), because it provides simple get/set
//! operations that can be used one at a time.
//!
//! Warning: While `BqlCell` and `BqlRefCell` are similar to their `std::cell`
//! counterparts, they are not interchangeable. Using `std::cell` types in
//! QEMU device implementations is usually incorrect and can lead to
//! thread-safety issues.
//!
//! ## `BqlCell<T>`
//!
//! [`BqlCell<T>`] implements interior mutability by moving values in and out of
//! the cell. That is, an `&mut T` to the inner value can never be obtained as
//! long as the cell is shared. The value itself cannot be directly obtained
//! without copying it, cloning it, or replacing it with something else. This
//! type provides the following methods, all of which can be called only while
//! the BQL is held:
//!
//!  - For types that implement [`Copy`], the [`get`](BqlCell::get) method
//!    retrieves the current interior value by duplicating it.
//!  - For types that implement [`Default`], the [`take`](BqlCell::take) method
//!    replaces the current interior value with [`Default::default()`] and
//!    returns the replaced value.
//!  - All types have:
//!    - [`replace`](BqlCell::replace): replaces the current interior value and
//!      returns the replaced value.
//!    - [`set`](BqlCell::set): this method replaces the interior value,
//!      dropping the replaced value.
//!
//! ## `BqlRefCell<T>`
//!
//! [`BqlRefCell<T>`] uses Rust's lifetimes to implement "dynamic borrowing", a
//! process whereby one can claim temporary, exclusive, mutable access to the
//! inner value:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn clear_interrupts(&self, val: u32) {
//!     // A mutable borrow gives read-write access to the registers
//!     let mut regs = self.registers.borrow_mut();
//!     let old = regs.interrupt_status();
//!     regs.update_interrupt_status(old & !val);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Borrows for `BqlRefCell<T>`s are tracked at _runtime_, unlike Rust's native
//! reference types which are entirely tracked statically, at compile time.
//! Multiple immutable borrows are allowed via [`borrow`](BqlRefCell::borrow),
//! or a single mutable borrow via [`borrow_mut`](BqlRefCell::borrow_mut).  The
//! thread will panic if these rules are violated or if the BQL is not held.
