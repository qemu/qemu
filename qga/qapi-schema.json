# @guest-sync-delimited:
#
# Echo back a unique integer value, and prepend to response a
# leading sentinel byte (0xFF) the client can check scan for.
#
# This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
# wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
# data from previous client. It must be issued upon initial
# connection, and after any client-side timeouts (including
# timeouts on receiving a response to this command).
#
# After issuing this request, all guest agent responses should be
# ignored until the response containing the unique integer value
# the client passed in is returned. Receival of the 0xFF sentinel
# byte must be handled as an indication that the client's
# lexer/tokenizer/parser state should be flushed/reset in
# preparation for reliably receiving the subsequent response. As
# an optimization, clients may opt to ignore all data until a
# sentinel value is receiving to avoid unnecessary processing of
# stale data.
#
# Similarly, clients should also precede this *request*
# with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any
# partially read JSON data from a previous client connection.

#
# This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
# wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
# data from previous client. All guest agent responses should be
# ignored until the provided unique integer value is returned,
# and it is up to the client to handle stale whole or
# partially-delivered JSON text in such a way that this response
# can be obtained.
#
# In cases where a partial stale response was previously
# received by the client, this cannot always be done reliably.
# One particular scenario being if qemu-ga responses are fed
# character-by-character into a JSON parser. In these situations,
# using guest-sync-delimited may be optimal.
#
# For clients that fetch responses line by line and convert them
# to JSON objects, guest-sync should be sufficient, but note that
# in cases where the channel is dirty some attempts at parsing the
