/*
 * This code implements a TCG which does not generate machine code for some
 * real target machine but which generates virtual machine code for an
 * interpreter. Interpreted pseudo code is slow, but it works on any host.
 *
 * Some remarks might help in understanding the code:
 *
 * "target" or "TCG target" is the machine which runs the generated code.
 * This is different to the usual meaning in QEMU where "target" is the
 * emulated machine. So normally QEMU host is identical to TCG target.
 * Here the TCG target is a virtual machine, but this virtual machine must
 * use the same word size like the real machine.
 * Therefore, we need both 32 and 64 bit virtual machines (interpreter).
