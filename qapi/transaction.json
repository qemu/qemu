##
# @transaction:
#
# Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically. If any
# operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be abandoned and the
# appropriate error returned.
#
# For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the file to use for
# the new snapshot, and the format.  The default format, if not specified, is
# qcow2.
#
# Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
# contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to reuse
# an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should ensure that
# the new image file has the same contents as the current one; QEMU cannot
# perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is achieved by using the
# current image file as the backing file for the new image.
#
# On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.
#
# For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the snapshot's
# name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already exists, the request will
# be rejected.  Only some image formats support it, for example, qcow2, rbd,
# and sheepdog.
#
# On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal snapshot in the
# transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during deletion, the user needs to fix
# it later with qemu-img or other command.
#
# @actions: List of @TransactionAction;
#           information needed for the respective operations.
#
# @properties: structure of additional options to control the
#              execution of the transaction. See @TransactionProperties
#              for additional detail.
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#
#          Errors depend on the operations of the transaction
#
# Note: The transaction aborts on the first failure.  Therefore, there will be
# information on only one failed operation returned in an error condition, and
# subsequent actions will not have been attempted.
