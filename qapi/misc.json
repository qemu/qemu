# @LostTickPolicy:
#
# Policy for handling lost ticks in timer devices.  Ticks end up getting
# lost when, for example, the guest is paused.
#
# @discard: throw away the missed ticks and continue with future injection
#           normally.  The guest OS will see the timer jump ahead by a
#           potentially quite significant amount all at once, as if the
#           intervening chunk of time had simply not existed; needless to
#           say, such a sudden jump can easily confuse a guest OS which is
#           not specifically prepared to deal with it.  Assuming the guest
#           OS can deal correctly with the time jump, the time in the guest
#           and in the host should now match.
#
# @delay: continue to deliver ticks at the normal rate.  The guest OS will
#         not notice anything is amiss, as from its point of view time will
#         have continued to flow normally.  The time in the guest should now
#         be behind the time in the host by exactly the amount of time during
#         which ticks have been missed.
#
# @slew: deliver ticks at a higher rate to catch up with the missed ticks.
#        The guest OS will not notice anything is amiss, as from its point
#        of view time will have continued to flow normally.  Once the timer
#        has managed to catch up with all the missing ticks, the time in
#        the guest and in the host should match.

#
# Requests that a guest perform a powerdown operation.
#
# Since: 0.14.0
#
# Notes: A guest may or may not respond to this command.  This command

# @cont:
#
# Resume guest VCPU execution.
#
# Since:  0.14.0
#
# Returns:  If successful, nothing
#
# Notes: This command will succeed if the guest is currently running.  It
#        will also succeed if the guest is in the "inmigrate" state; in
#        this case, the effect of the command is to make sure the guest
#        starts once migration finishes, removing the effect of the -S
#        command line option if it was passed.
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "cont" }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
##

##
# @x-exit-preconfig:
#

#
# This command makes QEMU exit the preconfig state and proceed with

# query-current-machine), wake-up guest from suspend if the guest is
# in SUSPENDED state. Return an error otherwise.
#
# Since:  1.1
#
# Returns:  nothing.
#
# Note: prior to 4.0, this command does nothing in case the guest
#       isn't suspended.
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "system_wakeup" }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
##

#
# Since:  0.14.0
#
# Note: prior to 2.1, this command was only supported for x86 and s390 VMs
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "inject-nmi" }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
##
{ 'command': 'inject-nmi' }

##
# @balloon:
#
# Request the balloon driver to change its balloon size.
#
# @value: the target size of the balloon in bytes

#            kernel module cannot support it, KvmMissingCap
#          - If no balloon device is present, DeviceNotActive
#
# Notes: This command just issues a request to the guest.  When it returns,
#        the balloon size may not have changed.  A guest can change the balloon
#        size independent of this command.
#
# Since: 0.14.0
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "balloon", "arguments": { "value": 536870912 } }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
##

# @human-monitor-command:
#
# Execute a command on the human monitor and return the output.
#
# @command-line: the command to execute in the human monitor
#
# @cpu-index: The CPU to use for commands that require an implicit CPU
#
# Features:
# @savevm-monitor-nodes: If present, HMP command savevm only snapshots
#                        monitor-owned nodes if they have no parents.
#                        This allows the use of 'savevm' with
#                        -blockdev. (since 4.2)
#
# Returns: the output of the command as a string
#
# Since: 0.14.0
#
# Notes: This command only exists as a stop-gap.  Its use is highly
#        discouraged.  The semantics of this command are not
#        guaranteed: this means that command names, arguments and
#        responses can change or be removed at ANY time.  Applications
#        that rely on long term stability guarantees should NOT
#        use this command.
#
#        Known limitations:
#
#        * This command is stateless, this means that commands that depend
#          on state information (such as getfd) might not work
#
#        * Commands that prompt the user for data don't currently work
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "human-monitor-command",
#      "arguments": { "command-line": "info kvm" } }
# <- { "return": "kvm support: enabled\r\n" }

# @change:
#
# This command is multiple commands multiplexed together.
#
# @device: This is normally the name of a block device but it may also be 'vnc'.
#          when it's 'vnc', then sub command depends on @target
#
# @target: If @device is a block device, then this is the new filename.
#          If @device is 'vnc', then if the value 'password' selects the vnc
#          change password command.   Otherwise, this specifies a new server URI
#          address to listen to for VNC connections.
#
# @arg: If @device is a block device, then this is an optional format to open
#       the device with.
#       If @device is 'vnc' and @target is 'password', this is the new VNC
#       password to set.  See change-vnc-password for additional notes.
#
# Features:

#     devices, use 'blockdev-change-medium' instead; for changing VNC
#     parameters, use 'change-vnc-password' instead.
#
# Returns: - Nothing on success.
