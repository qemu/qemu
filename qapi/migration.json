##
# @MigrationCapability:
#
# Migration capabilities enumeration
#
# @xbzrle: Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length Encoding).
#          This feature allows us to minimize migration traffic for certain work
#          loads, by sending compressed difference of the pages
#
# @rdma-pin-all: Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
#                mlock()'d on demand or all at once. Refer to docs/rdma.txt for usage.
#                Disabled by default. (since 2.0)
#
# @zero-blocks: During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently. This
#               essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire. Enabling requires
#               source and target VM to support this feature. To enable it is sufficient
#               to enable the capability on the source VM. The feature is disabled by
#               default. (since 1.6)
#
# @compress: Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
#            This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by sending
#            compressed pages. Please note that if compress and xbzrle are both
#            on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk stage, after that,
#            it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes effect, this can help to
#            minimize migration traffic. The feature is disabled by default.
#            (since 2.4 )
#
# @events: generate events for each migration state change
#          (since 2.4 )
#
# @auto-converge: If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest
#                 to speed up convergence of RAM migration. (since 1.6)
#
# @postcopy-ram: Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
#                been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed. The
#                capacity must have the same setting on both source and target
#                or migration will not even start. NOTE: If the migration fails during
#                postcopy the VM will fail.  (since 2.6)
#
# @x-colo: If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM on the
#          primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on secondary
#          side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck Stepping (COLO) for
#          Non-stop Service. (since 2.8)
#
# @release-ram: if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the source
#               during postcopy-ram migration. (since 2.9)
#
# @block: If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
#         devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
#         mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
#         offers more flexibility.
#         (Since 2.10)
#
# @return-path: If enabled, migration will use the return path even
#               for precopy. (since 2.10)
#
# @pause-before-switchover: Pause outgoing migration before serialising device
#                           state and before disabling block IO (since 2.11)
#
# @multifd: Use more than one fd for migration (since 4.0)
#
# @dirty-bitmaps: If enabled, QEMU will migrate named dirty bitmaps.
#                 (since 2.12)
#
# @postcopy-blocktime: Calculate downtime for postcopy live migration
#                      (since 3.0)
#
# @late-block-activate: If enabled, the destination will not activate block
#                       devices (and thus take locks) immediately at the end of migration.
#                       (since 3.0)
#
# @x-ignore-shared: If enabled, QEMU will not migrate shared memory (since 4.0)
#
# @validate-uuid: Send the UUID of the source to allow the destination
#                 to ensure it is the same. (since 4.2)
#
# @background-snapshot: If enabled, the migration stream will be a snapshot
#                       of the VM exactly at the point when the migration
#                       procedure starts. The VM RAM is saved with running VM.
#                       (since 6.0)

# @MigrationParameter:
#
# Migration parameters enumeration
#
# @announce-initial: Initial delay (in milliseconds) before sending the first
#                    announce (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-max: Maximum delay (in milliseconds) between packets in the
#                announcement (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-rounds: Number of self-announce packets sent after migration
#                   (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-step: Increase in delay (in milliseconds) between subsequent
#                 packets in the announcement (Since 4.0)
#
# @compress-level: Set the compression level to be used in live migration,
#                  the compression level is an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means
#                  no compression, 1 means the best compression speed, and 9 means best
#                  compression ratio which will consume more CPU.
#
# @compress-threads: Set compression thread count to be used in live migration,
#                    the compression thread count is an integer between 1 and 255.
#
# @compress-wait-thread: Controls behavior when all compression threads are
#                        currently busy. If true (default), wait for a free
#                        compression thread to become available; otherwise,
#                        send the page uncompressed. (Since 3.1)
#
# @decompress-threads: Set decompression thread count to be used in live
#                      migration, the decompression thread count is an integer between 1
#                      and 255. Usually, decompression is at least 4 times as fast as
#                      compression, so set the decompress-threads to the number about 1/4
#                      of compress-threads is adequate.
#
# @throttle-trigger-threshold: The ratio of bytes_dirty_period and bytes_xfer_period
#                              to trigger throttling. It is expressed as percentage.
#                              The default value is 50. (Since 5.0)
#
# @cpu-throttle-initial: Initial percentage of time guest cpus are throttled
#                        when migration auto-converge is activated. The
#                        default value is 20. (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-increment: throttle percentage increase each time
#                          auto-converge detects that migration is not making
#                          progress. The default value is 10. (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-tailslow: Make CPU throttling slower at tail stage
#                         At the tail stage of throttling, the Guest is very
#                         sensitive to CPU percentage while the @cpu-throttle
#                         -increment is excessive usually at tail stage.
#                         If this parameter is true, we will compute the ideal
#                         CPU percentage used by the Guest, which may exactly make
#                         the dirty rate match the dirty rate threshold. Then we
#                         will choose a smaller throttle increment between the
#                         one specified by @cpu-throttle-increment and the one
#                         generated by ideal CPU percentage.
#                         Therefore, it is compatible to traditional throttling,
#                         meanwhile the throttle increment won't be excessive
#                         at tail stage.
#                         The default value is false. (Since 5.1)
#
# @tls-creds: ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials for
#             establishing a TLS connection over the migration data channel.
#             On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials must
#             be for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
#             credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint. Setting this
#             will enable TLS for all migrations. The default is unset,
#             resulting in unsecured migration at the QEMU level. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-hostname: hostname of the target host for the migration. This is
#                required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
#                migration URI does not already include a hostname. For
#                example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the
#                hostname must be provided so that the server's x509
#                certificate identity can be validated. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-authz: ID of the 'authz' object subclass that provides access control
#             checking of the TLS x509 certificate distinguished name.
#             This object is only resolved at time of use, so can be deleted
#             and recreated on the fly while the migration server is active.
#             If missing, it will default to denying access (Since 4.0)
#
# @max-bandwidth: to set maximum speed for migration. maximum speed in
#                 bytes per second. (Since 2.8)
#
# @downtime-limit: set maximum tolerated downtime for migration. maximum
#                  downtime in milliseconds (Since 2.8)
#
# @x-checkpoint-delay: The delay time (in ms) between two COLO checkpoints in
#                      periodic mode. (Since 2.8)
#
# @block-incremental: Affects how much storage is migrated when the
#                     block migration capability is enabled.  When false, the entire
#                     storage backing chain is migrated into a flattened image at
#                     the destination; when true, only the active qcow2 layer is
#                     migrated and the destination must already have access to the
#                     same backing chain as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)
#
# @multifd-channels: Number of channels used to migrate data in
#                    parallel. This is the same number that the
#                    number of sockets used for migration.  The
#                    default value is 2 (since 4.0)
#
# @xbzrle-cache-size: cache size to be used by XBZRLE migration.  It
#                     needs to be a multiple of the target page size
#                     and a power of 2
#                     (Since 2.11)
#
# @max-postcopy-bandwidth: Background transfer bandwidth during postcopy.
#                          Defaults to 0 (unlimited).  In bytes per second.
#                          (Since 3.0)
#
# @max-cpu-throttle: maximum cpu throttle percentage.
#                    Defaults to 99. (Since 3.1)
#
# @multifd-compression: Which compression method to use.
#                       Defaults to none. (Since 5.0)
#
# @multifd-zlib-level: Set the compression level to be used in live
#                      migration, the compression level is an integer between 0
#                      and 9, where 0 means no compression, 1 means the best
#                      compression speed, and 9 means best compression ratio which
#                      will consume more CPU.
#                      Defaults to 1. (Since 5.0)
#
# @multifd-zstd-level: Set the compression level to be used in live
#                      migration, the compression level is an integer between 0
#                      and 20, where 0 means no compression, 1 means the best
#                      compression speed, and 20 means best compression ratio which
#                      will consume more CPU.
#                      Defaults to 1. (Since 5.0)
#
# @block-bitmap-mapping: Maps block nodes and bitmaps on them to
#                        aliases for the purpose of dirty bitmap migration.  Such
#                        aliases may for example be the corresponding names on the
#                        opposite site.
#                        The mapping must be one-to-one, but not necessarily
#                        complete: On the source, unmapped bitmaps and all bitmaps
#                        on unmapped nodes will be ignored.  On the destination,
#                        encountering an unmapped alias in the incoming migration
#                        stream will result in a report, and all further bitmap
#                        migration data will then be discarded.
#                        Note that the destination does not know about bitmaps it
#                        does not receive, so there is no limitation or requirement
#                        regarding the number of bitmaps received, or how they are
#                        named, or on which nodes they are placed.
#                        By default (when this parameter has never been set), bitmap
#                        names are mapped to themselves.  Nodes are mapped to their
#                        block device name if there is one, and to their node name
#                        otherwise. (Since 5.2)

# @migrate-set-parameters:
#
# Set various migration parameters.
#
# Since: 2.4
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "migrate-set-parameters" ,
#      "arguments": { "compress-level": 1 } }
#
##
{ 'command': 'migrate-set-parameters', 'boxed': true,
  'data': 'MigrateSetParameters' }

##
# @MigrationParameters:
#
# The optional members aren't actually optional.
#
# @announce-initial: Initial delay (in milliseconds) before sending the
#                    first announce (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-max: Maximum delay (in milliseconds) between packets in the
#                announcement (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-rounds: Number of self-announce packets sent after migration
#                   (Since 4.0)
#
# @announce-step: Increase in delay (in milliseconds) between subsequent
#                 packets in the announcement (Since 4.0)
#
# @compress-level: compression level
#
# @compress-threads: compression thread count
#
# @compress-wait-thread: Controls behavior when all compression threads are
#                        currently busy. If true (default), wait for a free
#                        compression thread to become available; otherwise,
#                        send the page uncompressed. (Since 3.1)
#
# @decompress-threads: decompression thread count
#
# @throttle-trigger-threshold: The ratio of bytes_dirty_period and bytes_xfer_period
#                              to trigger throttling. It is expressed as percentage.
#                              The default value is 50. (Since 5.0)
#
# @cpu-throttle-initial: Initial percentage of time guest cpus are
#                        throttled when migration auto-converge is activated.
#                        (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-increment: throttle percentage increase each time
#                          auto-converge detects that migration is not making
#                          progress. (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-tailslow: Make CPU throttling slower at tail stage
#                         At the tail stage of throttling, the Guest is very
#                         sensitive to CPU percentage while the @cpu-throttle
#                         -increment is excessive usually at tail stage.
#                         If this parameter is true, we will compute the ideal
#                         CPU percentage used by the Guest, which may exactly make
#                         the dirty rate match the dirty rate threshold. Then we
#                         will choose a smaller throttle increment between the
#                         one specified by @cpu-throttle-increment and the one
#                         generated by ideal CPU percentage.
#                         Therefore, it is compatible to traditional throttling,
#                         meanwhile the throttle increment won't be excessive
#                         at tail stage.
#                         The default value is false. (Since 5.1)
#
# @tls-creds: ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials
#             for establishing a TLS connection over the migration data
#             channel. On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials
#             must be for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
#             credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint.
#             An empty string means that QEMU will use plain text mode for
#             migration, rather than TLS (Since 2.7)
#             Note: 2.8 reports this by omitting tls-creds instead.
#
# @tls-hostname: hostname of the target host for the migration. This
#                is required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
#                migration URI does not already include a hostname. For
#                example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the
#                hostname must be provided so that the server's x509
#                certificate identity can be validated. (Since 2.7)
#                An empty string means that QEMU will use the hostname
#                associated with the migration URI, if any. (Since 2.9)
#                Note: 2.8 reports this by omitting tls-hostname instead.
#
# @tls-authz: ID of the 'authz' object subclass that provides access control
#             checking of the TLS x509 certificate distinguished name. (Since
#             4.0)
#
# @max-bandwidth: to set maximum speed for migration. maximum speed in
#                 bytes per second. (Since 2.8)
#
# @downtime-limit: set maximum tolerated downtime for migration. maximum
#                  downtime in milliseconds (Since 2.8)
#
# @x-checkpoint-delay: the delay time between two COLO checkpoints. (Since 2.8)
#
# @block-incremental: Affects how much storage is migrated when the
#                     block migration capability is enabled.  When false, the entire
#                     storage backing chain is migrated into a flattened image at
#                     the destination; when true, only the active qcow2 layer is
#                     migrated and the destination must already have access to the
#                     same backing chain as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)
#
# @multifd-channels: Number of channels used to migrate data in
#                    parallel. This is the same number that the
#                    number of sockets used for migration.
#                    The default value is 2 (since 4.0)
#
# @xbzrle-cache-size: cache size to be used by XBZRLE migration.  It
#                     needs to be a multiple of the target page size
#                     and a power of 2
#                     (Since 2.11)
#
# @max-postcopy-bandwidth: Background transfer bandwidth during postcopy.
#                          Defaults to 0 (unlimited).  In bytes per second.
#                          (Since 3.0)
#
# @max-cpu-throttle: maximum cpu throttle percentage.
#                    Defaults to 99.
#                    (Since 3.1)
#
# @multifd-compression: Which compression method to use.
#                       Defaults to none. (Since 5.0)
#
# @multifd-zlib-level: Set the compression level to be used in live
#                      migration, the compression level is an integer between 0
#                      and 9, where 0 means no compression, 1 means the best
#                      compression speed, and 9 means best compression ratio which
#                      will consume more CPU.
#                      Defaults to 1. (Since 5.0)
#
# @multifd-zstd-level: Set the compression level to be used in live
#                      migration, the compression level is an integer between 0
#                      and 20, where 0 means no compression, 1 means the best
#                      compression speed, and 20 means best compression ratio which
#                      will consume more CPU.
#                      Defaults to 1. (Since 5.0)
#
# @block-bitmap-mapping: Maps block nodes and bitmaps on them to
#                        aliases for the purpose of dirty bitmap migration.  Such
#                        aliases may for example be the corresponding names on the
#                        opposite site.
#                        The mapping must be one-to-one, but not necessarily
#                        complete: On the source, unmapped bitmaps and all bitmaps
#                        on unmapped nodes will be ignored.  On the destination,
#                        encountering an unmapped alias in the incoming migration
#                        stream will result in a report, and all further bitmap
#                        migration data will then be discarded.
#                        Note that the destination does not know about bitmaps it
#                        does not receive, so there is no limitation or requirement
#                        regarding the number of bitmaps received, or how they are
#                        named, or on which nodes they are placed.
#                        By default (when this parameter has never been set), bitmap
#                        names are mapped to themselves.  Nodes are mapped to their
#                        block device name if there is one, and to their node name
#                        otherwise. (Since 5.2)
