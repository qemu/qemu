##
# @device-list-properties:
#
# List properties associated with a device.
#
# @typename: the type name of a device
#
# Returns: a list of ObjectPropertyInfo describing a devices properties
#
# Note: objects can create properties at runtime, for example to describe
#       links between different devices and/or objects. These properties
#       are not included in the output of this command.
#
# Since: 1.2

{ 'command': 'device-list-properties',
  'data': { 'typename': 'str'},
  'returns': [ 'ObjectPropertyInfo' ] }

##
# @device_add:
#
# @driver: the name of the new device's driver
#
# @bus: the device's parent bus (device tree path)
#
# @id: the device's ID, must be unique
#
# Additional arguments depend on the type.
#
# Add a device.
#
# Notes:
# 1. For detailed information about this command, please refer to the
#    'docs/qdev-device-use.txt' file.
#
# 2. It's possible to list device properties by running QEMU with the
#    "-device DEVICE,help" command-line argument, where DEVICE is the
#    device's name
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "device_add",
#      "arguments": { "driver": "e1000", "id": "net1",
#                     "bus": "pci.0",
#                     "mac": "52:54:00:12:34:56" } }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
# TODO: This command effectively bypasses QAPI completely due to its
#       "additional arguments" business.  It shouldn't have been added to
#       the schema in this form.  It should be qapified properly, or
#       replaced by a properly qapified command.
#
# Since: 0.13

{ 'command': 'device_add',
  'data': {'driver': 'str', '*bus': 'str', '*id': 'str'},
  'gen': false } # so we can get the additional arguments

##
# @device_del:
#
# Remove a device from a guest
#
# @id: the device's ID or QOM path
#
# Returns: Nothing on success
#          If @id is not a valid device, DeviceNotFound
#
# Notes: When this command completes, the device may not be removed from the
#        guest.  Hot removal is an operation that requires guest cooperation.
#        This command merely requests that the guest begin the hot removal
#        process.  Completion of the device removal process is signaled with a
#        DEVICE_DELETED event. Guest reset will automatically complete removal
#        for all devices.
#
# Since: 0.14
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "device_del",
#      "arguments": { "id": "net1" } }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
# -> { "execute": "device_del",
#      "arguments": { "id": "/machine/peripheral-anon/device[0]" } }
# <- { "return": {} }
#
##
{ 'command': 'device_del', 'data': {'id': 'str'} }

##
# @DEVICE_DELETED:
#
# Emitted whenever the device removal completion is acknowledged by the guest.
# At this point, it's safe to reuse the specified device ID. Device removal can
# be initiated by the guest or by HMP/QMP commands.
#
# @device: device name
#
# @path: device path
#
# Since: 1.5
#
# Example:
#
# <- { "event": "DEVICE_DELETED",
#      "data": { "device": "virtio-net-pci-0",
#                "path": "/machine/peripheral/virtio-net-pci-0" },
#      "timestamp": { "seconds": 1265044230, "microseconds": 450486 } }
