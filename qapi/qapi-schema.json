# = Introduction
#
# This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.
#
# Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user
# Monitor, this means that any other document which also describe
# commands (the manpage, QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be
# consulted.
#
# QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands.  Regular
# commands usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while
# query commands just return information.  The sections below are
# divided accordingly.
#
# It's important to observe that all communication examples are
# formatted in a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to
# understand.  However, in real protocol usage, they're emitted as a
# single line.
#
# Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:
#
# Example:
#
# ::
#
#   -> data issued by the Client
#   <- Server data response
#
# Please refer to the
# :doc:`QEMU Machine Protocol Specification </interop/qmp-spec>`
# for detailed information on the Server command and response formats.

# Documentation generated with qapi-gen.py is in source order, with
# included sub-schemas inserted at the first include directive
# (subsequent include directives have no effect).  To get a sane and
# stable order, it's best to include each sub-schema just once, or
# include it first right here.
