# @ErrorClass
#
# QEMU error classes
#
# @GenericError: this is used for errors that don't require a specific error
#                class. This should be the default case for most errors
#
# @CommandNotFound: the requested command has not been found
#
# @DeviceEncrypted: the requested operation can't be fulfilled because the
#                   selected device is encrypted
#
# @DeviceNotActive: a device has failed to be become active
#
# @DeviceNotFound: the requested device has not been found
#
# @KVMMissingCap: the requested operation can't be fulfilled because a
#                 required KVM capability is missing
#
# Since: 1.2

# @VersionInfo:
#
# A description of QEMU's version.
#
# @qemu.major:  The major version of QEMU
#
# @qemu.minor:  The minor version of QEMU
#
# @qemu.micro:  The micro version of QEMU.  By current convention, a micro
#               version of 50 signifies a development branch.  A micro version
#               greater than or equal to 90 signifies a release candidate for
#               the next minor version.  A micro version of less than 50
#               signifies a stable release.
#
# @package:     QEMU will always set this field to an empty string.  Downstream
#               versions of QEMU should set this to a non-empty string.  The
#               exact format depends on the downstream however it highly
#               recommended that a unique name is used.
