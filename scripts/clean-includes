# Clean up QEMU #include lines by ensuring that qemu/osdep.h

# This work is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2

# Usage:
#   clean-includes [--git subjectprefix] file ...
# or
#   clean-includes [--git subjectprefix] --all
#
# If the --git subjectprefix option is given, then after making
# the changes to the files this script will create a git commit
# with the subject line "subjectprefix: Clean up includes"
# and a boilerplate commit message.
#
# Using --all will cause clean-includes to run on the whole source
# tree (excluding certain directories which are known not to need
# handling).

# This script requires Coccinelle to be installed.

# .c files will have the osdep.h included added, and redundant
# includes removed.
# .h files will have redundant includes (including includes of osdep.h)
# removed.
# Other files (including C++ and ObjectiveC) can't be handled by this script.

# The following one-liner may be handy for finding files to run this on.
# However some caution is required regarding files that might be part
# of the guest agent or standalone tests.

# for i in $(git ls-tree --name-only HEAD) ; do test -f $i && \
#   grep -E '^# *include' $i | head -1 | grep 'osdep.h' ; test $? != 0 && \
#   echo $i ; done

$GITSUBJ: Clean up includes

Clean up includes so that osdep.h is included first and headers
which it implies are not included manually.

This commit was created with scripts/clean-includes.
