# To reproduce bug we need to overflow int by one sequential discard, so we
# need size > 2G, bigger cluster size (as with default 64k we may have maximum
# of 512M sequential data, corresponding to one L1 entry), and we need some
# data of the beginning of the disk mapped to the end of file to prevent
# bdrv_co_truncate(bs->file) call in qcow2_co_truncate(), which might succeed
# anyway.
