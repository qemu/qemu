# The first write results in a growth of the refcount table during an allocation
# which has precisely the required size so that the new refcount block allocated
# in alloc_refcount_block() is right after cluster_index; this did lead to a
# different refcount block being written to disk (a zeroed cluster) than what is
# cached (a refblock with one entry having a refcount of 1), and the second
# write would then result in that cached cluster being marked dirty and then
# in it being written to disk.
# This should not happen, the new refcount structures may not conflict with
# new_block.

# This write results in a refcount table growth; but the refblock allocated
# immediately before that (new_block) takes cluster index 4 (which is now free)
# and is thus not self-describing (in contrast to test 1, where new_block was
# self-describing). The refcount table growth algorithm then used to place the
# new refcount structures at cluster index 65536 (which is the same as the
# cluster_index parameter in this case), allocating a new refcount block for
# that cluster while new_block already existed, leaking new_block.
# Therefore, the new refcount structures may not be put at cluster_index
# (because new_block already describes that cluster, and the new structures try
# to be self-describing).
