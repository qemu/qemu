# Create an image with an L1 table and a refcount table that each span twice the
# number of clusters which can be described by a single refblock; therefore, at
# least two refblocks cannot count their own refcounts because all the clusters
# they describe are part of the L1 table or refcount table.

# One refblock can describe (with cluster_size=512 and refcount_bits=64)
# 512/8 = 64 clusters, therefore the L1 table should cover 128 clusters, which
# equals 128 * (512/8) = 8192 entries (actually, 8192 - 512/8 = 8129 would
# suffice, but it does not really matter). 8192 L2 tables can in turn describe
# 8192 * 512/8 = 524,288 clusters which cover a space of 256 MB.

# Since with refcount_bits=64 every refcount block entry is 64 bits wide (just
# like the L2 table entries), the same calculation applies to the refcount table
# as well; the difference is that while for the L1 table the guest disk size is
# concerned, for the refcount table it is the image length that has to be at
# least 256 MB. We can achieve that by using preallocation=metadata for an image
# which has a guest disk size of 256 MB.

# We know for sure that the L1 and refcount tables do not overlap with any other
# structure because the metadata overlap checks would have caught that case.

# Because qemu refuses to open qcow2 files whose L1 table does not cover the
# whole guest disk size, it is definitely large enough. On the other hand, to
# test whether the refcount table is large enough, we simply have to verify that
# indeed all the clusters are allocated, which is done by qemu-img check.

# The final thing we need to test is whether the tables are actually covered by
# refcount blocks; since all clusters of the tables are referenced, we can use
# qemu-img check for that purpose, too.
