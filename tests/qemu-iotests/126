# Note that we could also do the same test with BASE_IMG=file:image:base.$IMGFMT
# -- but behavior for that case is a bit strange. Protocol-prefixed paths are
# in a sense always absolute paths, so such paths will never be combined with
# the path of the overlay. But since "image:base.$IMGFMT" is actually a
# relative path, it will always be evaluated relative to qemu's CWD (but not
# relative to the overlay!). While this is more or less intended, it is still
# pretty strange and thus not something that is tested here.
# (The root of the issue is the use of a relative path with a protocol prefix.
#  This may always give you weird results because in one sense, qemu considers
#  such paths absolute, whereas in another, they are still relative.)
