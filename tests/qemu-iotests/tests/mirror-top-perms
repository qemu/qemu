        Before commit 53431b9086b28, mirror-top used to not take any
        permissions but WRITE and share all permissions.  Because it
        is inserted between the source's original parents and the
        source, there generally was no parent that would have taken or
        unshared any permissions on the source, which means that an
        external process could access the image unhindered by locks.
        (Unless there was a parent above the protocol node that would
        take its own locks, e.g. a format driver.)
        This is bad enough, but if the mirror job is then cancelled,
        the mirroring VM tries to take back the image, restores the
        original permissions taken and unshared, and assumes this must
        just work.  But it will not, and so the VM aborts.

        Commit 53431b9086b28 made mirror keep the original permissions
        and so no other process can "steal" the image.

        (Note that you cannot really do the same with the target image
        and then completing the job, because the mirror job always
        took/unshared the correct permissions on the target.  For
        example, it does not share READ_CONSISTENT, which makes it
        difficult to let some other qemu process open the image.)
