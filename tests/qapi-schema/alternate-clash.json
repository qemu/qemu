# Alternate branch name collision
# Reject an alternate that would result in a collision in generated C
# names (this would try to generate two enum values 'ALT1_KIND_A_B').
# TODO: In the future, if alternates are simplified to not generate
# the implicit Alt1Kind enum, we would still have a collision with the
# resulting C union trying to have two members named 'a_b'.
