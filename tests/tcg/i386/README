These are i386 specific guest programs

test-i386
---------

This program executes most of the 16 bit and 32 bit x86 instructions and
generates a text output, for comparison with the output obtained with
a real CPU or another emulator.

The Linux system call modify_ldt() is used to create x86 selectors
to test some 16 bit addressing and 32 bit with segmentation cases.

The Linux system call vm86() is used to test vm86 emulation.

Various exceptions are raised to test most of the x86 user space
exception reporting.

linux-test
----------

This program tests various Linux system calls. It is used to verify
that the system call parameters are correctly converted between target
and host CPUs.
