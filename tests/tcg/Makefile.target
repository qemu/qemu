# These are complicated by the fact we want to build them for guest
# systems. This requires knowing what guests we are building and which
# ones we have cross-compilers for or docker images with
# cross-compilers.
#
# The tests themselves should be as minimal as possible as
# cross-compilers don't always have a large amount of libraries
# available.
#
# We only include the host build system for SRC_PATH and we don't
# bother with the common rules.mk. We expect the following:
#
#   CC - the C compiler command
#   EXTRA_CFLAGS - any extra CFLAGS
#   BUILD_STATIC - are we building static binaries
#
# By default all tests are statically compiled but some host systems
# may not package static libraries by default. If an external
# cross-compiler can only build dynamic libraries the user might need
# to make extra efforts to ensure ld.so can link at runtime when the
# tests are run.
#
# We also accept SPEED=slow to enable slower running tests
#
# We also expect to be in the tests build dir for the FOO-(linux-user|softmmu).
