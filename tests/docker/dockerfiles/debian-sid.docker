#
# Debian Sid Base
#
# A number of our guests exist as ports only. We can either use the
# ports repo or get everything from Sid. However Sid is a rolling
# distro which may be broken at any particular time. If you are
# unlucky and try and build your images while gcc is in the process of
# being uploaded this can fail. Your only recourse is to try again in
# a few hours when the repos have re-synced. Once built however you
# won't be affected by repo changes unless the docker recipies are
# updated and trigger a re-build.
#

# This must be earlier than the snapshot date we are aiming for
