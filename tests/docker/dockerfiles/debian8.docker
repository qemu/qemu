# Docker multiarch cross-compiler target
#
# This docker target is builds on Debian and Emdebian's cross compiler targets
# to build distro with a selection of cross compilers for building test binaries.
#
# On its own you can't build much but the docker-foo-cross targets
# build on top of the base debian image.
