 * Our goal is to ensure that we run a single full migration
 * iteration, and also dirty memory, ensuring that at least
 * one further iteration is required.
 *
 * We can't directly synchronize with the start of a migration
 * so we have to apply some tricks monitoring memory that is
 * transferred.
 *
 * Initially we set the migration bandwidth to an insanely
 * low value, with tiny max downtime too. This basically
 * guarantees migration will never complete.
 *
 * This will result in a test that is unacceptably slow though,
 * so we can't let the entire migration pass run at this speed.
 * Our intent is to let it run just long enough that we can
 * prove data prior to the marker has been transferred *AND*
 * also prove this transferred data is dirty again.
 *
 * Before migration starts, we write a 64-bit magic marker
 * into a fixed location in the src VM RAM.
 *
 * Then watch dst memory until the marker appears. This is
 * proof that start_address -> MAGIC_OFFSET_BASE has been
 * transferred.
 *
 * Finally we go back to the source and read a byte just
 * before the marker until we see it flip in value. This
 * is proof that start_address -> MAGIC_OFFSET_BASE
 * is now dirty again.
 *
 * IOW, we're guaranteed at least a 2nd migration pass
 * at this point.
 *
 * We can now let migration run at full speed to finish
 * the test
