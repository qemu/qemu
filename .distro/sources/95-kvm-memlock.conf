# The KVM HV implementation on Power can require a significant amount
# of unswappable memory (about half of which also needs to be host
# physically contiguous) to hold the guest's Hash Page Table (HPT) -
# roughly 1/64th of the guest's RAM size, minimum 16MiB.
#
# These limits allow unprivileged users to start smallish VMs, such as
# those used by libguestfs.
