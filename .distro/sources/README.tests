qemu-kvm-tests README
=====================

The qemu-kvm-tests rpm contains tests that can be used to verify the
functionality of the installed qemu-kvm package

When installed, the files from this rpm will be arranged in the following
directory structure

tests-src/
├── README
├── scripts
│   ├── qemu.py
│   └── qmp
└── tests
    ├── acceptance
    ├── Makefile.include
    └── qemu-iotests

The tests/ directory within the tests-src/ directory is setup to remain a copy
of a subset of the tests/ directory from the QEMU source tree

The avocado_qemu tests and qemu-iotests, along with files required for the
execution of the avocado_qemu tests (scripts/qemu.py and scripts/qmp/) will be
installed in a new location - /usr/lib64/qemu-kvm/tests-src/

avocado_qemu tests:
The avocado_qemu tests can be executed by running the following avocado command:
avocado run -p qemu_bin=/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm /usr/lib64/qemu-kvm/tests/acceptance/
Avocado needs to be installed separately using either pip or from source as
Avocado is not being packaged for RHEL.

qemu-iotests:
symlinks to corresponding binaries need to be created for QEMU_PROG,
QEMU_IO_PROG, QEMU_IMG_PROG, and QEMU_NBD_PROG before the iotests can be
executed.

The primary purpose of this package is to make these tests available to be
executed as gating tests for the qemu-kvm in the RHEL OSCI environment.
