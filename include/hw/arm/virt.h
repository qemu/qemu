 * Emulate a virtual board which works by passing Linux all the information
 * it needs about what devices are present via the device tree.
 * There are some restrictions about what we can do here:
 *  + we can only present devices whose Linux drivers will work based
 *    purely on the device tree with no platform data at all
 *  + we want to present a very stripped-down minimalist platform,
 *    both because this reduces the security attack surface from the guest
 *    and also because it reduces our exposure to being broken when
 *    the kernel updates its device tree bindings and requires further
 *    information in a device binding that we aren't providing.
 * This is essentially the same approach kvmtool uses.
