/*
 * Currently the iova tree will only allow to keep ranges
 * information, and no extra user data is allowed for each element.  A
 * benefit is that we can merge adjacent ranges internally within the
 * tree.  It can save a lot of memory when the ranges are split but
 * mostly continuous.
 *
 * Note that current implementation does not provide any thread
 * protections.  Callers of the iova tree should be responsible
 * for the thread safety issue.
